Bronze Goals
--For this prize I will be focusing on the format, layout, and organization of the html such as deciding which tags, classes, and IDs to use to construct the rings and pegs of the tower.
--With the user in mind I am visualizing how the tower containing all the rings look and also how the two other empty pegs look.
I have in mind how the operations of the game will be like. The user needs to be able to click in two places when playing the game. Once on the ring, which the users decides to move, and second the destination of the the clicked on ring.
--I am thinking about how to display on the screen the fact that the user is playing the game tower of Hanoi.











Silver Goals
--Deciding where the user will be clicking in order to take the actions to play the game.
--What will the user see when a ring is clicked.
--What will the user see when a destination is clicked.
--Make the pegs so the user can see where to click.








Gold Goals
--Thinking about having an opening sequence to the game where the user clicks start and the pegs and tower phase in.
--I want to display in the background a high quality picture of the city of Hanoi.
--A move counter where the user can see how many moves it took to complete.
--A prompt that will notify the user when the game has been won.
